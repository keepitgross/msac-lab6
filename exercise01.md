# Exercise 1 - Setting up your first repository

1. Create a new, empty directory

        mkdir my_repository

2. `cd` into it

        cd my_repository

3. Initialize it as a git repository.

        git init

4. Where are the internals of the repository stored? Paste the output of the following command on macOS & Linux.

        ls -lA

_______________________________________________________________________________

The internals of the repository are stored in the index. 
The index allows the user to review the changes made before the 'commit' action is taken. 

macOS & Linux command: ls -lA
ls-lA lists files in long format while showing invisible files.
It also displays extended attribute keys and sizes with the output on one entry per line.
