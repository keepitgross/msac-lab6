# Exercise 7 - More than one changed file

1. Ensure you have a clean working directory

        git status

2. Edit one of your `fruits.txt`, add a few items

        blueberry
        strawberry
        

3. Edit `appliances.txt` and add a few items

        dishwasher
        dryer
        etc.

4. Look at git status, paste the output here

        git status


On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        my_r/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
